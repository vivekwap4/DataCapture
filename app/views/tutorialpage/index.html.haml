                Accesses entered data for their projects
              %li
                Can download entered data for their projects

              %li
                Enters data for a project using a form
              %li
                Not necessarily part of the research group (this is why there are separate logins)
              %li
                Should login using a username, password, and project ID (which would be given to them by the researcher) so they are presented with the correct project's form for entering data
              %li
                If a project has multiple data entry forms, data entry people should login in using a form ID as well as password and project ID (form ID would also be provided by researchers)
              %li
                Upon login, they will be presented with the data entry form specified by their project ID (or project ID and form ID) so they can enter standardized data

                Created and "owned" by researchers
              %li
                Can have 1+ data entry forms associated with them
              %li
                Need a name upon creation (REDcap also has users select a "project type", but that is more advanced)

            Forms
        .row
          %p
            %ul
              %li
                REDcap calls them "data collection instruments" (this video shows how everything works in REDcap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYXdFiPfus)
              %li
                Many forms can be associated with individual projects
              %li
                Forms are created by the researcher and presented to data entry people
              %li
                Form creation should be dynamic, i.e. researcher chooses what fields to add, what kinds of fields they are, what they're called, etc. (great video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_FNKR7jahM)
              %li
                Keep fields simple for now - can expand later
